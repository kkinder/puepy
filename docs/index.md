# PuePy: Overview

PuePy is a frontend web framework that builds on Python and Webassembly using [PyScript](https://pyscript.net). PuePy is
*truly* a Python-first development environment. There is no transpiling to JavaScript; no Yarn, no NPM, no webpack, no
Vite or Parcel. Python runs directly in your browser. PuePy is inspired by Vue.js, but is built entirely from scratch in
Python.

## Features

- **Reactivity**: As components' state changes, redraws happen automatically
- **Component-Based Design**: Encapsulate data, logic, and presentation in reusable components
- **Single-Class Components**: Based vaguely on Vue's "single file components", each component and each page is a class.
- **Events, Slots, and Props**: Events, slots, and props are all inspired by Vue and work similarly in PuePy
- **Minimal, Python**: PuePy is built to use Pythonic conventions whenever possible, and eschews verbosity in the name
  of opinion.
